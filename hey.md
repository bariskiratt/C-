## C Type strings
### A brief look to C type strings
C type strings are strings which are initialized by array of characters, and each character can be manipulated by [] operator 
```

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char myString[]{ "string" };
    myString[1] = 'p';
    std::cout << myString << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
